# Project Summary
This project contains the lead scan data from a major conference. 

# Project Data
* The data for this project can be found in the `data` folder as `.csv` files.
* There may be people with the same name. Make sure to use the Attendee ID
    to confirm uniqueness.

## Before you start
* There is a lot of data, but the data will never get updated, so read and
process the data throughly during start up and do not read the data again.
Reading the data more than one time is unnecessary and will cost a lot of tokens.
